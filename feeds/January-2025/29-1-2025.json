      "description": "\u003cp\u003e\nSecurity researcher RyotaK\n\u003ca href=\"https://flatt.tech/research/posts/clone2leak-your-git-credentials-belong-to-us/\"\u003e\nhas shared\u003c/a\u003e a series of vulnerabilities that all have to do with how Git\ninterfaces with external\ncredential managers. In short, while Git guards against newline characters\n(\u003ctt\u003e\\n\u003c/tt\u003e) being injected into a repository's URL, some programming languages\nalso treat carriage return characters (\u003ctt\u003e\\r\u003c/tt\u003e) as being newlines. Adding a\ncarriage return to a repository's URL can cause Git and the credential manager\nto disagree on how the URL should be parsed, ultimately resulting in Git\ncredentials being sent to the wrong host. Malicious repositories could include\nGit submodules with malformed URLs, triggering the bug. Only password-based authentication\nwith an external credential manager is\nvulnerable to this attack; SSH-based authentication remains secure. The Git project\nhas chosen to consider this a vulnerability in Git, given the large amount of\nexternal software affected. The project has fixed the bug on its end by\n\u003ca href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.48.1.txt\"\u003e\nreleasing updates\u003c/a\u003e for all supported versions that ban\ncarriage returns in URLs entirely.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAffected software includes GitHub Desktop, Git LFS, and possibly other Git utilities:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"bq\"\u003e\nSince Git itself doesn't use .lfsconfig file, specifying the URL that contains\nthe newline character in .lfsconfig causes Git LFS to insert the newline character\ninto the message, while bypassing [...] Git's validation.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
