Since the system's page tables\nregulate access to memory, they are an attractive target for this type of\nattack.  \u003ca\nhref=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250108103250.3188419-1-kevin.brodsky@arm.com\"\u003eThis patch \nset\u003c/a\u003e from Kevin Brodsky is an attempt to protect page tables (and,\neventually, other data structures) using the \"memory protection keys\"\nfeature provided by a number of CPU architectures.",

      "description": "\u003ca href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/01/09/Rust-1.84.0.html\"\u003eVersion\n1.84.0\u003c/a\u003e of the Rust language has been released.  Changes include\nimproved version selection for dependencies in Cargo, the beginning of the\nmigration to a new trait solver, and some updated pointer-provenance APIs.\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"bq\"\u003e\n\tMost of the time, programmers do not need to worry much about\n\tprovenance, and it is very clear how a pointer got\n\tderived. However, when casting pointers to integers and back, the\n\tprovenance of the resulting pointer is underspecified. With this\n\trelease, Rust is adding a set of APIs that can in many cases\n\treplace the use of integer-pointer-casts, and therefore avoid the\n\tambiguities inherent to such casts. In particular, the pattern of\n\tusing the lowest bits of an aligned pointer to store extra\n\tinformation can now be implemented without ever casting a pointer\n\tto an integer or back. This makes the code easier to reason about,\n\teasier to analyze for the compiler, and also benefits tools like\n\tMiri and architectures like CHERI that aim to detect and diagnose\n\tpointer misuse.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
