They were very kind and generous with us and even if it's a shame we have to move out on a short notice, all things come to an end.\u003c/q\u003e\"\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe current cost for the services, much of which is for 50TB of \u003cstrike\u003ebandwidth\u003c/strike\u003e data transfer\nper month and a half-dozen beefy servers for running continuous-integration\n(CI) jobs, comes to around $24,000 per month.  Tissoires believes that the\nproject should start paying for service somewhere, in order to avoid\nupheaval of this sort, sometimes on short or no notice. \"\u003cq\u003eI personally\nthink we better have fd.o pay for its own servers, and then have sponsors\nchip in. This way, when a sponsor goes away, it's technically much simpler\nto just replace the money than change datacenter.\u003c/q\u003e\"  Various options are\nbeing discussed there, but any move is likely to disrupt normal services\nfor a week or more.",
