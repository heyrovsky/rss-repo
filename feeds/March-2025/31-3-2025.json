The kernel may migrate pages for many reasons,\nincluding defragmentation, improving NUMA locality, moving data to or from\nmemory hosted on a peripheral device, or freeing a range of\nmemory for other uses.  Given the importance of migration to the\nmemory-management subsystem, there is a lot of interest in improving its\nperformance and removing impediments to its success.  Several sessions in\nthe memory-management track of the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,\nMemory-Management, and BPF Summit were dedicated to this topic.",
