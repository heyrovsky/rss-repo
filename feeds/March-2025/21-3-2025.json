It is rare\n\tfor any kernel patch to survive the mailing list without at least a\n\tcouple of non-trivial changes, and Rust abstractions are no\n\texception. Every time an abstraction used by our driver is merged,\n\twe must drop our downstream version and rebase the driver atop the\n\tversion accepted upstream. This is grueling, menial, and\n\tunpleasant work, and Janne has our deepest gratitude for\n\tvolunteering his time to get through it.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
