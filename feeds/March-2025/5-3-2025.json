In the\n1990s, it was even thought that parallel graph-reduction\narchitectures could make functional programming languages much faster than their\nimperative counterparts. Alas, that prediction mostly failed to materialize.\nEven though graphs are still used as a theoretical formalism in order to define\nand optimize functional languages (such as Haskell's\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/implementing-lazy-functional-languages-on-stock-hardware-the-spineless-tagless-g-machine/\"\u003e\nspineless tagless graph-machine\u003c/a\u003e), they are still mostly compiled down to the same old\nnon-parallel assembly code that every other language uses.
