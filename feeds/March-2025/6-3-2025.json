However, CMAC\n\twas not designed as a hash function, and therefore it is a weak\n\thash function against an adversary who has the key. Remember that\n\tevery AMD Zen CPU has to have the same AES-CMAC key in order to\n\tsuccessfully calculate the hash of the AMD public key and the\n\tmicrocode patch contents. Therefore, the key only needs to be\n\trevealed from a single CPU in order to compromise all other CPUs\n\tusing the same key. This opens up the potential for hardware\n\tattacks (e.g., reading the key from ROM with a scanning electron\n\tmicroscope), side-channel attacks (e.g., using Correlation Power\n\tAnalysis to leak the key during validation), or other software or\n\thardware attacks that can somehow reveal the key. In summary, it is\n\ta safe assumption that such a key will not remain secret forever.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
