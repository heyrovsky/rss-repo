While initially -- and still to this day with the likes of the TUXEDO X Elite laptop not materializing yet -- being focused on Windows 11 on ARM, there was hope among Linux users this would lead to a nice ARM Linux laptop experience, since after all Qualcomm and Linaro were working on enhancing the support for Linux. Now approaching the one year point, the overall state of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite support and performance is rather disappointing. Here's a look at where things currently are and performance relative to AMD Ryzen and Intel Core Ultra when making use of the latest Ubuntu Linux support.",

In these setups, individual disk reads often take multiple\n\tmilliseconds, introducing substantial latency compared to local\n\tSSDs.\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tWith traditional synchronous I/O, each of these reads blocks query\n\texecution until the data arrives, leading to idle CPU time and\n\tdegraded throughput. By contrast, asynchronous I/O allows Postgres\n\tto issue multiple read requests in parallel and continue processing\n\twhile waiting for results. This reduces query latency and enables\n\tmuch more efficient use of available I/O bandwidth and CPU cycles.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
