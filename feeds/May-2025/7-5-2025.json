      "description": "\u003cp\u003eThe Debian project has the concept of \u003ca\nhref=\"https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html#essential-packages\"\u003eessential\npackages\u003c/a\u003e, which provide the bare minimum functionality considered\nabsolutely necessary (or \"essential\") for a system to\nfunction. Packages tagged as essential, and the packages that are\nrequired by the set of essential packages, are always installed as\npart of a Debian system. However, Debian's packaging rules do not\nrequire developers to explicitly declare dependencies on that set of\npackages (the essential set) but they can simply rely on the fact that those\nwill always be present. That means that changing the essential set, as\nthe project may wish to do occasionally, is more complicated than it\nshould be. This came to light recently when a Debian developer asked\nwhat might be required to remove \u003ca\nhref=\"https://linux.die.net/man/1/mawk\"\u003e\u003ctt\u003emawk\u003c/tt\u003e\u003c/a\u003e to slim down\nthe project's container images.\u003c/p\u003e",

We don't believe that the openSUSE Deepin packager acted\nwith bad intent when he implemented the \"license agreement\" dialog to\nbypass our whitelisting restrictions. The dialog itself makes the\nsecurity concerns we have transparent, so this does not happen in a\nsneaky way, at least not towards users. It was not discussed with us,\nhowever, and it violates openSUSE packaging policies. Beyond the\nsecurity aspect, this also affects general packaging quality\nassurance: the D-Bus configuration files and Polkit policies installed\nby the \u003ctt\u003edeepin-feature-enable\u003c/tt\u003e package are unknown to the package\nmanager and won't be cleaned up upon package removal, for\nexample. Such bypasses are not deemed acceptable by us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe combination of these factors led us to the decision to remove\nthe Deepin desktop completely from openSUSE Tumbleweed and from the\nfuture Leap 16.0 release. In openSUSE Leap 15.6 we will remove the\noffending \u003ctt\u003edeepin-feature-enable\u003c/tt\u003e package only. It is a difficult\ndecision given that the Deepin desktop has a considerable number of\nusers. We firmly believe the Deepin packaging and security assessment\nin openSUSE needs a reboot, however, ideally involving new people that\ncan help get the Deepin packages into shape, establish a relationship\nwith Deepin upstream and keep an eye on bugfixes, thus avoiding\nfruitless follow-up reviews that just waste our time. In such a new\nsetup we would be willing to have a look at all the sensitive Deepin\ncomponents again one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe announcement goes into detail about the bypass of\nopenSUSE packaging policy and the history of security reviews of\nDeepin components. It also offers guidance on \u003ca\nhref=\"https://security.opensuse.org/2025/05/07/deepin-desktop-removal.html#5-how-to-continue-using-deepin-on-opensuse\"\u003econtinuing\nto use Deepin Desktop\u003c/a\u003e on openSUSE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
