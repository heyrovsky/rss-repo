He said:\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"bq\"\u003e\nI'll be honest: I truly wanted the code I wrote for the new Vector Sets data type to be released under an open source license. Writing open source software is too rooted in me: I rarely wrote anything else in my career. I'm too old to start now. This may be childish, but I wrote Vector Sets with a huge amount of enthusiasm exactly because I knew Redis (and my new work) was going to be open source again.\n\u003cp\u003e\nI understand that the core of our work is to improve Redis, to continue building a good system, useful, simple, able to change with the requirements of the software stack. Yet, returning back to an open source license is the basis for such efforts to be coherent with the Redis project, to be accepted by the user base, and to contribute to a human collective effort that is larger than any single company. So, honestly, while I can't take credit for the license switch, I hope I contributed a little bit to it, because today I'm happy. I'm happy that Redis is open source software again, under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nSince last year's license switch, though, the \u003ca\nhref=\"https://valkey.io/\"\u003eValkey\u003c/a\u003e project has sprung up as a fork under\nthe original 3-clause BSD license.",
