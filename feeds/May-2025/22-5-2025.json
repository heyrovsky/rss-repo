      "description": "Last week I began posting Linux benchmarks of the flagship \"Strix Halo\" SoC, the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ PRO 395 with powerful Radeon 8060S graphics using the HP ZBook Ultra G1a laptop. Both the CPU and GPU results for the data published thus far have been mighty impressive and done at the Ubuntu Linux defaults... But the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 within the ZBook Ultra G1a can be pushed even further by leveraging the ACPI Platform Profiles capabilities. In this article is showing how much further performance -- and the power costs -- can be achieved out of this AMD Strix Halo SoC when leveraging the HP Power Profiles as well as the power efficiency for those wanting to run the SoC instead in the \"power saver\" / \"low power\" configuration.",
