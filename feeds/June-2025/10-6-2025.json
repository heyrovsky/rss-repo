      "description": "The Linux 6.15 kernel cycle started off a bit rough with a heavy hitting performance regression spotted and then fixed but to only then discover another Linux 6.15 performance regression affecting modern AMD CPUs. Fortunately those issues were cleared out in time for the recent Linux 6.15 stable release. Linux 6.15 stable is looking good especially on 5th Gen AMD EPYC \"Turin\" servers with some recent benchmarks showing some modest gains over the Linux 6.14 kernel.",
