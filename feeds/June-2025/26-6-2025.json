Prior to using this engine, CfR used an ad-hoc method for matching patterns of code. This engine is the same as the one used for Coccinelle for C, with a few minor changes. Most of the changes were idiomatic but to the same effect. More information on the engine and its language (CTL-VW) can be found in the \u003ca href=\"https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/papers/popl09.pdf\"\u003ePOPL Paper\u003c/a\u003e. With a standard engine, each step of the matching process can be logged, allowing us to learn and reuse the same design patterns from Coccinelle for C, including critical test cases.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
