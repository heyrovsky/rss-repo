      "description": "Last month with the launch of the AMD EPYC 4005 \"Grado\" series for entry-level Zen 5 servers we ran benchmarks of the AMD EPYC 4565P and EPYC 4585PX processors as the top-tier 16-core CPUs. They delivered an excellent combination of performance, power efficiency, and most of all value for those looking to assemble an AM5-based budget-oriented server in 2025 and beyond. Those processors destroyed the Intel Xeon 6300 series competition's flagship, the Xeon 6369P that is simply 8 cores / 16 threads in 2025... Being curious about the core-for-core performance between the AMD EPYC 4005 series and Intel Xeon 6300 series, I got my hands on an AMD EPYC 4345P as the Grado 8-core processor to see how it performs against that Xeon E-2400 series replacement as well as how the performance compares to the prior generation 8-core EPYC 4344P.",
