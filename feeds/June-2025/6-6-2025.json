Nyxt is not an Emacs package, but a full\nweb browser written in Common Lisp and available under the BSD\nthree-clause license. Its target audience is developers who want a\nbrowser that is keyboard-driven and extensible; Nyxt is also developed\nfor Linux first, rather than Linux being an afterthought or just a\nsliver of its audience. The philosophy (as described in its \u003ca\nhref=\"https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/faq\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e)\nbehind the project is that users should be able to customize all of\nthe browser's functionality.\u003c/p\u003e",
