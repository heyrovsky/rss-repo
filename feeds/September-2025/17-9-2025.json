Many users who would ordinarily move\nto the next version are blocked by Windows\u0026#160;11's hardware\nrequirements unless they are willing to buy a newer PC. The \"\u003ca\nhref=\"https://endof10.org/\"\u003eEnd of 10\u003c/a\u003e\" campaign is an effort to\nconvince those users to switch to Linux rather than sticking with an\nend-of-life operating system or buying a new Windows system. At\nAkademy\u0026#160;2025, Dr. Joseph De\u0026#160;Veaugh-Geiss,\nBettina Louis,  Carolina Silva Rodé, and Nicole Teale discussed their\nwork on the campaign, its progress so far, and what's next.\u003c/p\u003e",
