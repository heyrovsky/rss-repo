Previous to this, each new FreeDOS distribution (like\n1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) required bundling up packages into a \"release\ncandidate,\" and we would go through several iterations of updating the\nrelease candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJerome's method of building the FreeDOS distribution made it easier\nto automate a test release, which we decided to update every month. As\nthe test releases accumulated enough changes to warrant a release, we\ncould then make the next test release a \"release candidate\" which\nwould iterate to the next version of the FreeDOS distribution. Since\n2022, we've released monthly test releases.
