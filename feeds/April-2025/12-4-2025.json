      "description": "Knowing how frequently accessed a page of memory is (its \"hotness\") is a\nkey input to many memory-management heuristics.  Jonathan Cameron, in a\nmemory-management track at the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,\nMemory-Management, and BPF Summit, pointed out that the number of sources\nof that kind of data is growing over time.  He wanted to explore the\nquestions of what commonality exists between data from those sources, and\nwhether it makes sense to aggregate them all somehow.",
