      "description": "In the first filesystem-track session at the 2025 Linux Storage,\nFilesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit (LSFMM+BPF), virtual\nfilesystem (VFS) layer co-maintainer Christian Brauner had a few different\ntopics he wanted to talk about.  Issues on the agenda\nincluded iterating through anonymous mount namespaces, a needed feature\nfor ID-mapped mounts, the perennial unprivileged mounts topic, potentially\nusing hazard pointers for file reference counting, and Rust bindings.  He\ndid not expect to get through all of them in the 30 minutes allotted, but\nthe session did move along pretty quickly to at least\nintroduce them to the assembled filesystem developers.",
