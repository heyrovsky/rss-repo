This includes ASCII art with a \"⚠️\"\nwarning emoji to display the execution path when it detects a problem (like\nan infinite loop in one of his examples), better C++ template errors,\nmachine-readable diagnostics using \u003ca href=\"https://sarif.info/\"\u003eStatic\nAnalysis Results Interchange Format\u003c/a\u003e (SARIF), better messages regarding\nC23 compatibility since that is the default C version for GCC 15, and more.\nSince the changes are focused on messages, there is the inevitable color-scheme update as well:\n\u003cblockquote class=\"bq\"\u003e\nGCC will use color when emitting its text messages on stderr at a suitably modern terminal, using a few colors that seem to work well in a number of different terminal themes—but the exact rules for choosing which color to use for each aspect of the output have been rather arbitrary.\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor GCC 15, I've gone through C and C++'s errors, looking for places where two different things in the source are being contrasted, such as type mismatches. These diagnostics now use color to visually highlight and distinguish the differences. \n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
