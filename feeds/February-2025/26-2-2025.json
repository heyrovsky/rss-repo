This is a\nsubscriber-only feature, and it works by creating a unique fetch URL for\neach user.  We will, of course, be counting on our readers to not share\nthose URLs.\n\u003cp\u003e\nAnother feature we have had requests for is to automatically present the\nsite in dark-mode colors when a reader's browser has been configured to\nprefer it.  That feature, too, is now available.  In this case, we had to\nthink about the interaction between automatic selection and the color\ncustomization that the site has long had.  The conclusion we reached is\nthat, if custom colors have been configured for an account, they will win\nout over the automatic selection.  There is a new preference in the \u003ca\nhref=\"https://lwn.net/MyAccount/preferences/\"\u003ecustomization area\u003c/a\u003e to change this\ndefault if desired.\n\u003cp\u003e\nBoth of these features — and the other enhancements we have made recently —\nwere enabled by the support of LWN's subscribers.  By making it possible to\nbring in new staff last year, you created the space to improve the site\nexperience while keeping up with the writing.  We thank all of you for your\nsupport.",

The AMD P-State driver being used by default now for the EPYC 9005 series processors on Linux 6.12+ and paired with Power Profile option tuning can deliver a nice boost to server energy efficiency with only modest impact to the performance.
