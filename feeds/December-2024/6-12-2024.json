However, for some customers this is not\n\tenough to be able to adopt OSS solutions as in their evaluations\n\tsome provisions in common licenses like the GPL-3 are at odds with\n\tregulatory constraints they are subject to. Apertis does not set to\n\tsolve this decades-long debate, and instead its goal is to increase\n\tthe adoption of modern, maintained OSS solutions in markets where\n\tthis has historically been a challenge. To enable this, Apertis\n\tsupports avoiding the use of any software under some licenses (like\n\tthe [GPL v3.0 license family) on target images, while still making\n\tthem fully available for development and for customers that do not\n\tshare those licensing concerns. To avoid these licenses, Apertis\n\tuses more modern alternatives instead of relying on outdated and\n\tunmaintained pre-GPL-3 versions. For instance, coreutils and\n\tfindutils (GPL-3+) are replaced in Apertis by rust-coreutils and\n\trust-findutils.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
