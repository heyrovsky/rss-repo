Both projects would preserve Elisp compatibility, which is a\nmust, but they would use Guile differently.  The first talk we will cover\nwas given by Robin Templeton, who described the relaunch of the \u003ca\nhref=\"https://guile-emacs.org/\"\u003eGuile-Emacs project\u003c/a\u003e, which would replace\nthe Elisp in Emacs with a compiler using Guile.
