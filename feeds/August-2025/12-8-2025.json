A fully correct BPF program can still be\nused to expose sensitive data, for example.\nTo remedy this, Blaise Boscaccy and KP Singh\nhave both shared patch sets that add ways to verify cryptographic\nsignatures of BPF programs, allowing users to configure their kernels to load\nonly pre-approved BPF programs. This work follows on from the\n\u003ca href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1017549/\"\u003e\ndiscussion\u003c/a\u003e at the\nLinux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit (LSFMM+BPF)\nin April and Boscaccy's\n\u003ca href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250502184421.1424368-1-bboscaccy@linux.microsoft.com/\"\u003e\nearlier proposal\u003c/a\u003e of a Linux Security Module (LSM) to accomplish the same goal.\nThere are\nstill some fundamental disagreements over the best approach to signing BPF\nprograms, however.\n\u003c/p\u003e",

While the hope was it would better cope with the ever growing list of CPU speculative execution vulnerabilities, the effort was thwarted initially by I/O throughput seeing a 70% performance hit. That level of performance cost was unsustainable. But now that I/O overhead has been reduced to just 13%...",
