Pablo Galindo Salgado noticed that when he started programming in\nPython ten years ago or so; it bugged him enough that he helped fill the hole. The results will be delivered in October with Python\u0026#160;3.14.\nAt \u003ca href=\"https://ep2025.europython.eu/\"\u003eEuroPython\u0026#160;2025\u003c/a\u003e, he\ngave a characteristically fast-paced and humorous look at debugging and\nwhat will soon be possible for Python debugging—while comparing it all to\nmedical diagnosis.",

Beyond the improvements thanks to the Zen 5 microarchitecture enhancements, the new Threadrippers while working as a drop-in replacement to existing TRX50 workstation motherboards now can handle DDR5-6400 R-DIMMs up from DDR5-4800 R-DIMMs with the Threadripper 7000 series. For those wondering about the gain attributed to the faster memory modules, here are benchmarks looking at the DDR5-4800 vs. DDR5-6400 real-world performance impact for AMD Ryzen Threadripper 9970X and 9980X CPUs.",

The result will be no\nupdates for \"\u003cq\u003efour to six months\u003c/q\u003e\".  The project is recommending that\nits users \"\u003cq\u003eshould uninstall the OS\u003c/q\u003e\" and wait for an all-clear\nsignal.
