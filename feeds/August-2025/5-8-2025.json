      "description": "The use of huge pages can significantly increase the performance of many\nworkloads by reducing both memory-management overhead in the kernel and\npressure on the system's translation lookaside buffer (TLB).  The addition\nof transparent huge pages (THP) for the 2.6.38 kernel release in 2011\ncaused the kernel to allocate huge pages automatically to make their\nbenefits available to all workloads without any effort needed on the\nuser-space side.  But it turns out that use of huge pages can make some\nworkloads slower as the result of internal memory fragmentation, so the THP\nfeature is often disabled.  Two patch sets aimed at better targeting the\nuse of transparent huge pages are currently working their way through the\nreview process.",

Already in its effectively final state aside from any last minute fixes, I've begun running Debian 13 testing builds on various systems in the lab to great success. With two years since Debian 12, the new software packages of Debian 13 help in delivering better performance especially on modern systems. Here is a look at Debian 12 versus Debian 13 performance on an AMD EPYC server across 130 benchmarks. Coincidentally, Debian 13 is coming in at 13% faster than Debian 12.",
