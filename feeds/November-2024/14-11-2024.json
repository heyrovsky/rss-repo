As is so often the case, DMA is rather more complicated in\npractice, and the kernel has developed a complicated internal API to\nsupport it.  It turns out that the DMA API, as it exists now, can affect\nthe performance of some high-bandwidth devices.  In an effort to address\nthat problem, Leon Romanovsky is making the API even more complex with \u003ca\nhref=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/cover.1731244445.git.leon@kernel.org\"\u003ethis patch series\u003c/a\u003e\nadding a new two-step mapping API.",
