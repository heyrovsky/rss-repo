Maintainer Felix Winkelmann has\nshared\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.more-magic.net/posts/chicken-6.html\"\u003e\nan article\u003c/a\u003e about what changes to expect in version 6 of the language, including better Unicode support and support for the\n\u003ca href=\"https://r7rs.org/\"\u003e\nR7RS (small)\u003c/a\u003e Scheme standard.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"bq\"\u003e\nEvery major release is a chance of fixing long-standing problems with the codebase and address bad design decisions. CHICKEN is now nearly 25 years old and we had many major overhauls of the system. Sometimes these caused a lot of pain, but still we always try to improve things and hopefully make it more enjoyable and practical for our users. There are places in the code that are messy, too complex, or that require cleanup or rewrite, always sitting there waiting to be addressed. On the other hand CHICKEN has been relatively stable compared to many other language implementations and has a priceless community of users that help us improving it. Our users never stop reminding us of what could be better, where the shortcomings are, where things are hard to use or inefficient.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
