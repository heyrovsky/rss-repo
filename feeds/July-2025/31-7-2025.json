The EPYC 4565P is their standard 16-core offering while the EPYC 4585PX is the 3D V-Cache variant for these processors catering to web hosting, SOHO servers, edge computing, and other applications where not needing the performance of the flagship EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" processors. There is also another 16-core variant with the EPYC 4545P and what makes this SKU interesting is the 16-cores / 32-threads but with a 65 Watt TDP. In the Ryzen 9000 series so far AMD hasn't introduced any 16-core, 65-Watt part that makes the EPYC 4545P all the more interesting. Here are some benchmarks of the EPYC 4545P for those shopping for an affordable and very power efficient server platform that still sharply outperforms Intel's Xeon E / Xeon 6300 competition.",
