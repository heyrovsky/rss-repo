Even with lower core counts and fewer memory channels, the modern EPYC 4005 \"Grado\" processors were able to outpace that original EPYC \"Naples\" flagship processor from 2017. With carrying out the fresh re-testing of the AMD EPYC 7601 on a modern 2025 Linux software stack, in today's article is a look at how the EPYC 7601 Zen 1 performance compares to the EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" series with today's flagship EPYC 9755 and EPYC 9965 processors.",
