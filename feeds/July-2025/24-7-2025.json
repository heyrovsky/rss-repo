A big feat he's been tackling is enabling support for analog display connectors within the AMDGPU driver for the \"DC\" code. Besides a few supported older GPUs having DVI-I connections, this analog support is significant in that it's a milestone for unblocking the aging GCN 1.0 and GCN 1.1 GPUs from using the modern AMDGPU driver by default...",
