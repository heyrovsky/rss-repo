      "description": "\u003cp\u003eLinux containers have made it reasonably easy to develop, distribute, and\ndeploy server applications along with all the distribution dependencies that they\nneed. For example, anyone can deploy and run a Debian-based \u003ca\nhref=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres\"\u003ePostgreSQL container\u003c/a\u003e \non a Fedora\u0026#160;Linux host. \u003ca\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/\"\u003eDistrobox\u003c/a\u003e is a project that is designed to\nbring the cross-distribution compatibility to the desktop and allow users to\nmix-and-match Linux distributions without fussing with dual-booting, virtual\nmachines, or multiple computers. It is an ideal way to install\nadditional software on image-based systems, such as Fedora's \u003ca\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/\"\u003eAtomic Desktops\u003c/a\u003e\nor \u003ca href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1046228/\"\u003eBazzite\u003c/a\u003e, and also\nprovides a convenient way to move a development environment or\nfavorite applications to a new system.\u003c/p\u003e",
