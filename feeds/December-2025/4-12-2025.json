The LargestIntegralType typedef has\nbeen replaced with \u003ctt\u003eintmax_t\u003c/tt\u003e and \u003ctt\u003euintmax_t\u003c/tt\u003e from\n\u003ctt\u003estdint\u003c/tt\u003e.h, providing better type safety and portability across\ndifferent platforms. Additionally, we've adopted the bool type where\nappropriate, making the code more expressive and self-documenting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsing \u003ctt\u003eintmax_t\u003c/tt\u003e and \u003ctt\u003euintmax_t\u003c/tt\u003e also allows to print\nbetter error messages. So you can now find\ne.g. \u003ctt\u003eassert_int_equal\u003c/tt\u003e and \u003ctt\u003eassert_uint_equal\u003c/tt\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ecmocka 2.0 introduces a comprehensive set of type-specific\nassertion macros, including `assert_uint_equal()`,\n`assert_float_equal()`, and enhanced pointer assertions. The mocking\nsystem has also been significantly improved with type-specific macros\nlike `will_return_int()` and `will_return_float()`. The same for\nparameter checking etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLWN \u003ca href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/558106/\"\u003ecovered\u003c/a\u003e the\nproject early in its development in 2013.
