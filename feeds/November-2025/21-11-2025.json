The io_uring subsystem, too, can be thought of as a way of loading\nprograms in the kernel, though the programs in question are mostly a\nsequence of I/O-related system calls.  It has sometimes seemed inevitable\nthat io_uring would, like many other parts of the kernel, gain BPF\ncapabilities as a way of providing more flexibility to user space.  That\nhas not yet happened, but there are currently two patch sets under\nconsideration that take different approaches to the problem.",

Recently with having some spare cycles and gratis access still to the Microsoft Azure HBv5 instance for AMD EPYC Zen 4 with HBM3, I ran some Clang 20 vs. Clang 21 performance benchmarks there for those wondering about any performance benefits of this new compiler release on Zen 4.",
