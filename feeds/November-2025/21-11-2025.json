The io_uring subsystem, too, can be thought of as a way of loading\nprograms in the kernel, though the programs in question are mostly a\nsequence of I/O-related system calls.  It has sometimes seemed inevitable\nthat io_uring would, like many other parts of the kernel, gain BPF\ncapabilities as a way of providing more flexibility to user space.  That\nhas not yet happened, but there are currently two patch sets under\nconsideration that take different approaches to the problem.",
